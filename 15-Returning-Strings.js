// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

// [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]


function greet(name){
  
    //your code here
    
  
    let nom = `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
    
    return nom;
  }

   //   another way to get the same result


   function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + " how are you doing today?";
  }

  function greet(name){
    return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
  }
